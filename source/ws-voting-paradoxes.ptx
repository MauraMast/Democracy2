  %PLURALITY METHOD FAILS HEAD-TO-HEAD CRITERION
  \item The Des Moines Running Club is electing a new team captain.
        There are three candidates:  Irving, Joseph, and Karl.
        The preference table is the following.
        \begin{center}
          \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c} \hline
                       & \multicolumn{3}{c|}{\# of Ballots} \\
            Ranking    & 4 & 3 & 2 \\ \hline\hline
            1st choice & J & I & K  \\
            2nd choice & I & J & I  \\
            3rd choice & K & K & J  \\ \hline
          \end{tabular}
        \end{center}
        \begin{enumerate}
          \item If the club uses the plurality method,
                who will win the election? \ifsolns\fbox J \fi
                \fillwithlines{\stretch{1}}
          \item If it were a head-to-head race between Irving and Joseph, who would win? \ifsolns\fbox I \fi
                \fillwithlines{\stretch{1}}
          \item If it were a head-to-head race between Irving and Karl, who would win? \ifsolns\fbox I \fi
                \fillwithlines{\stretch{1}}
          \item If it were a head-to-head race between Joseph and Karl, who would win? \ifsolns\fbox J \fi
                \fillwithlines{\stretch{1}}
          \item Why does the plurality method's result seem unfair in this election?
                \ifsolns Irving defeats Joseph and Karl in head-to-head matches, but Joseph wins via plurality.\fi
                \fillwithlines{\stretch{1}}
        \end{enumerate}

  \item \boxedblank{\textbf{Head-to-Head Criterion:} 
	
	\ifsolns  A candidate who beats all the other candidates head to head should win the election. \fi          \fillwithlines{\stretch{1}}} \index{criterion!head to head}
